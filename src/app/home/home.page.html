              <p>
                I know I was acting up unnecessarily and I was being a complete
                d*ck. What I did concerning the whole you ghosting on WhatsApp
                was also completely uncalled for also...

              <p>
                I completely understand you and why you were even tired of the
                whole stuff lol and I'm really sorry for adding to your
                frustration. I've given it a lot of thought I probably even have
                read the whole "Scroll. Since this week, Uche I've been
                reassuring you that everything's fine and we're good..." like
                300 times now and each time I regret my behaviour.

                I'm also deeply sorry if I've been unknowingly putting you
                through anything that feels remotely similar to what Abdul did
                and I'm glad you said that cause it gave me a chance to reflect.
                I really do not want to put you through the same pain again
                that's the last thing I'd ever want.

                and should I say forgive me now lol. I f*cking love you Ese
